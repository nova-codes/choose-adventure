The player is welcomed to the summer camp where they are taken on a journey through multiple days and left with a difficult decision that will altar their lives forevermore.

The player then will continue to experience the thrill of the story with 8-bit style images and choices options along the way.

As the player progresses, the choices will become more difficult and take you down alternating paths.

And what choose your own adventure would be complete without a couple of death screens and failed attempts along the way!
