We know it’s not ideal, but we don’t want to risk losing any more of you. We’ve contacted your families to come pick you up.’\nShe continues… ‘Back in 1974, when I was a camper, just like you, something like this began happening  where other campers went missing. First, one camper disappeared, then the numbers exponentially grew…until 13 campers and counselors seemed to vanish out of thin air. \nThey didn’t send us home, so we were stuck in our cabins every day, fearing we were next and  just praying we would be sent home. Police were called. Investigations were made. Pastors, rabbis, and any clergy folk  would try and cleanse the grounds. They all said the problem would never occur again after their “work,” so the camp remained open and the case of the missing persons became a mystery of the decade. I’ve gotten off track and I am not trying to scare you.\nYou all have 2 hours - head back to your cabins, pack up your things and meet at the main circle to load the buses.' The chatter and fear was palpable as everyone reluctantly stood up from their spots and quickly made their way back to their cabins to pack up their things.",
